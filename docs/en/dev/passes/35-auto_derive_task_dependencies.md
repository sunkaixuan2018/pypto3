# AutoDeriveTaskDependencies Pass

## Overview

`AutoDeriveTaskDependencies` derives conservative task-to-task dependency
edges inside `with pl.manual_scope():` regions. It runs after
[`DeriveCallDirections`](33-derive_call_directions.md), reads the resolved
`Call.attrs["arg_directions"]`, and writes compiler-owned producer TaskId
edges to `Call.attrs["compiler_manual_dep_edges"]`.

User-written `pl.submit(..., deps=[...])` edges remain in
`Call.attrs["manual_dep_edges"]`. The two attrs are intentionally separate so
IR dumps preserve provenance; orchestration codegen merges and deduplicates
them immediately before emitting `Arg::set_dependencies(...)`.

## Position in the pipeline

```text
... -> DeriveCallDirections -> AutoDeriveTaskDependencies -> CollectCommGroups -> Simplify (final)
```

The pass only changes manual runtime scopes. Auto scopes keep the runtime
OverlapMap behaviour unchanged.

## Algorithm

For each function body:

1. Build a conservative storage-location map for tensor Vars. Direct aliases,
   loop carries, tuple elements, `tensor.assemble`, and cross-function outputs
   inherit the same storage root and region when the root can be traced.
2. Preserve storage lineage through `IfStmt.return_vars` when both branches
   yield the same traced storage root. Matching regions are preserved; differing
   regions widen to unknown.
3. Track constant rectangular `tensor.slice` windows as regions relative to the
   storage root. Slices with symbolic shape or offset fall back to an unknown
   region and overlap conservatively.
4. Treat MemRef-backed shaped values as aliases when `MemRef::MayAlias` reports
   the same base allocation with overlapping or symbolic byte ranges.
5. Collect statically bound producer TaskIds from `pl.submit` tuple tails.
6. Walk each `RuntimeScopeStmt(manual=true)` in source order, maintaining prior
   accesses for that manual scope only.
7. For every non-builtin call with resolved `arg_directions`, classify tensor
   arguments as read, write, or read-write. Accesses to the same storage root,
   or to MemRef roots that may alias, are considered for region overlap.
8. Skip dependency edges for statically proven disjoint regions. Otherwise, add
   a compiler edge from any prior producer TaskId when RAW, WAR, or WAW hazards
   exist. Read-read pairs do not produce edges. User-written edges are respected
   and not duplicated.

If a hazard depends on a prior producer whose TaskId was not statically bound,
the pass raises a targeted `ValueError` asking the user to submit the producer
as `out, tid = pl.submit(...)`.

## Properties

| Required | Produced | Invalidated |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `SplitIncoreOrch`, `CallDirectionsResolved` | `CallDirectionsResolved` | — |

The pass preserves `CallDirectionsResolved`: it rewrites only dependency attrs,
not call arguments or `arg_directions`.
